# Brain-Tumor-Detection

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for brain tumor detection using MRI images, achieving 100% accuracy. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of MRI scans classified into tumor-positive and tumor-negative cases. The preprocessing pipeline includes image resizing (128Ã—128 pixels), normalization, and dataset splitting using scikit-learn. The CNN model, built using TensorFlow/Keras, leverages convolutional layers for feature extraction and learns meaningful patterns, resulting in perfect classification performance. This system aids in automated medical diagnosis, assisting radiologists, and improving early tumor detection. It enhances clinical decision-making and medical imaging analysis. The project highlights the potential of deep learning in healthcare. Future improvements may include transfer learning and real-world dataset evaluation to further validate its effectiveness.
